# README.md

Hey! My name is MÃ¡ja and I am a Computational Linguistics student from the Czech Republic :czech_republic: Currently, I am studying at the University of Helsinki :finland: as an exchange student!

I used to be a Windows user but one year ago I partially switched to Linux :penguin: 

I've tried Deepin, Fedora, CentOS, and then Manjaro running KDE. But I wanted something simpler to work with, so now I am dualbooting Win10 with Pop!\_OS running GNOME. You can see my current configuration [here](https://github.com/AiKuroyake/Dracula-Pop-Dotfiles).

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
